Hi there, my name is Michael Duergner; I'm working as a freelance software developer, software architect and software project manager. You can find me professional info over at http://sprucehill.io

I started writing code with Java and the Spring Framework about nearly 15 years ago; I had some glimpses with Grails and Groovy (which I really like for the stuff that Java is missing).

Lately I had some closer looks at CoffeeScript, NodeJS and AngularJS especially for rapid prototyping and showcasing new ideas.

You
