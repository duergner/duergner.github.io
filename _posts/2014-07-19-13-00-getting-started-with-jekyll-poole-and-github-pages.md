So that's the first post on the new blog; it's been set up using Github Pages and the master from Poole.

Worked straight forward, simple, clean and minimalistic look & feel. And using Jekyll under the hood blogging should be easy and fast.

So let's hope I stay motivated to do some more blogging now.
